# Project Summary
Given the surge of online shopping, online retailers may get a lot of site traffic but what ultimately matters is whether or not users finalize their purchase. Marketing and User Experience teams are tasked with optimizing a site’s interface and content in order to improve customer retention and the site’s revenue. Given this, understanding customer browsing behaviour and web page features is crucial for not only improving the user’s experience, but also maximizing the retailer’s revenue.

This project aims to analyze various features of online shopper’s sessions on a site to predict whether the customer makes a purchase. We will use the dataset, [Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
